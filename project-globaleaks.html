					<h1>Globaleaks</h1>
					<p>GlobaLeaks is the first open-source whistleblowing framework. It empowers anyone to easily set up and maintain a whistleblowing platform. GlobaLeaks can help many different types of users: media organizations, activist groups, corporations and public agencies. 
					<br/>GlobaLeaks is a project aimed at supporting the practice of whistleblowing by giving people the software tools necessary to start their own initiative. Thanks to GlobaLeaks even non-technical people will be able to setup their own anonymous whistleblowing site on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android).
					<br/>GlobaLeaks provides high levels of security and anonymity by default, though these parameters can be flexibly changed. This allows the operator to tweak the system in order to reach the right security/usability tradeoff  that he feels comfortable with.
					<br/>GlobaLeaks aims at becoming the de-facto standard in technologically-powered whistleblowing, thanks to its unique usability, security and integrable APIs.
					</p>
					<p>It is now financially supported by:</p>

					<h2>Where to use</h2>
					<p>Possible use case of GlobaLeaks.</p>
					<h2>Media</h2>
					<p>Media outlets, including newspapers, websites, magazines and non-profit journalism associations, can set up a GlobaLeaks interface to collect anonymous reports from sources that will be protected by default. Some media organizations already have deployed whistleblowing sites to accept "leaks" that can inform their investigative journalism, but it is difficult for journalistic organizations to maintain the technology necessary for security and privacy. GlobaLeaks can provide an open-source alternative that could be used by any of these organizations and many others. Several media organizations already are seriously considering the use of GlobaLeaks.     </p>
					<h2>Transparency Activism</h2>
					<p>Non-governmental and informal activist organizations can set up independent whistleblowing sites and promote them. Such sites could be used to uncover corruption or other problems locally, or within specific industries. This can be true even when the issues might not get attention nationally or among the mainstream. Anonymity backed by technological security can help such organizations even in places where organized crime is dominant or human rights are not guaranteed.</p>        
					<h2>Corporations</h2>
					<p>Corporations can set up whistleblowing sites as part of their internal accountability policies managed by auditing departments, allowing them to spot waste, corruption and malpractice. Employees can be incentivized to voice their concerns as part of compliance with corporate responsibility laws.</p>
					<h2>Public Agencies</h2>
					<p>Public agencies can use GlobaLeaks to involve citizens in spotting tax evasion, corruption, market manipulation and other problems. Famous public whistleblowing services already exist and include those in the U.S IRS, U.S. SEC, and the EU Antitrust. GlobaLeaks can help protect those citizens who want to help investigators.</p>
					<h2>What GlobaLeaks is not</h2>
					<p>GlobaLeaks is flexible and suited for many purposes. But there are a few things that GlobaLeaks is NOT.
						<ul>
							<li><strong>GlobaLeaks is not the new WikiLeaks.</strong><br/>In fact we have nothing in common. We provide a software; they provide a service. We are an open-source community; they're a closed group of individuals operating behind a public face. We do not handle leaked documents; they do.</li>
							<li><strong>GlobaLeaks is not a corporate whistleblowing service.</strong><br/>GlobaLeaks is simply free and open-source software.</li>
							<li><strong>GlobaLeaks has nothing in common with OpenLeaks.</strong><br/>OpenLeaks is a service in which whistleblowers trust OpenLeaks to manage and maintain their data and information. GlobaLeaks is an open-source software project that does not manage data or information. However, GlobaLeaks is designed to potentially allow the creation of many OpenLeaks-like services in zero time.</li>
							<li><strong>GlobaLeaks start-up isn't sponsored by anyone.</strong><br/>GlobaLeaks is the result of the efforts of a group of independent developers. While it aims to remain independent and will always offer its services for free, GlobaLeaks projects has received financial support by organization such as <a href="https://code.google.com/soc/" target="_blank">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href="http://serbia.usaid.gov" target="_blank">USAID Serbia</a>, and <a href="http://f2c.rfa.org/" target="_blank">Radio Free Asia</a>.</li>
							<li><strong>GlobaLeaks doesn't want your data.</strong><br/>When you set up a "GlobaLeaks node" - another term for a whistleblowing site - you don't become part of a network, but rather just a node on your own. We invite you to report the existence of your whistleblowing site in <a href="http://leakdirectory.org" target="_blank">LeakDirectory</a>, but that's really up to you.</li>
							<li><strong>GlobaLeaks doesn't track anyone.</strong><br/>The website <a href="http://globaleaks.org/" target="_blank">http://globaleaks.org</a> is never requested or in any way connected to any of the running GlobaLeaks nodes. Therefore there's no way we can know how many nodes exist, or where and when a user interacts with any of these nodes. </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h2>Motivation and Goals</h2>
					<p><em>Why we think transparency is important</em></p>
					<p>
						GlobaLeaks strives to increase accountability and transparency in our society. When information that affects the public remains hidden, democracy and economies cease to work properly.
						<br/>We are interested in fulfilling the needs of diverse public interest use cases: from media to public agencies, from corporations to activists. We use the term framework to emphasize the flexibility of the GlobaLeaks platform. For example, the whistleblower will be anonymous by default, but if the whistleblower chooses to disclose their identity, the framework allows them to do so.
						Entities that require whistleblowers to identify themselves can do that as well.
						<br/>We believe that people should demand governments and companies to be more accountable for their actions. As well we believe that governments and economies that embrace openness will benefit by promoting trust and enabling informed discourse and decision-making.
					</p>
					<p>We believe it is important to make an open-source tool because this allows many types of people to use GlobaLeaks and enables the creation of a community that can constantly make contributions to improve the framework. </p>
					<p>Organizations that promote whistleblowing and transparency are not a new development: there are people who have been active in this field for decades, and groups such as Public Concern At Work have existed for years. Other organizations such as WikiLeaks have more recently captured the world's attention. Not all of these groups have the same definition of "whistleblowing", but many of them have faced similar obstacles.</p>
					<p>A key problem is the difficulty of maintaining the privacy of the whistleblower. We at GlobaLeaks come from a strong information security background and have designed our platform to be as secure and privacy-preserving as possible.</p>
					<p>The GlobaLeaks suite of software will empower people to stand up anonymously no matter what their definition of "whistleblowing" is. The person or organization running the software will be able to customize the platform to suit their needs. GlobaLeaks is designed with flexibility in mind, while enabling maximal privacy and security by default.</p>
					<p>The technologies we use to guarantee the security and anonymity of communications are called Tor Hidden Services. These technologies protect both the computer that is sending the information and the server that receives it. Both the whistleblower and the server that gets the messages are as immune from retaliation attacks as possible. </p>
					<h2>Tell me more about the software!</h2>
					<p>GlobaLeaks 0.2 has been fully re-designed in a very modular way, so the software architecture is composed of 3 main components:
						<ul>
							<li><strong>GlobaLeaks Client</strong><br/>The GlobaLeaks Web Client (GLClient) is a modern JavaScript application that allows whistleblowers, node administrators and receivers to interact with the GlobaLeaks Server.</li>
							<li><strong>GlobaLeaks Backend</strong><br/>The GlobaLeaks Backend Server (GLBackend) is the piece of software installed by the node administrator and responsible for handling the reception of submissions from whistleblowers and the notification to the targets.</li>
							<li><strong>Anonymous Python Application Framework</strong><br/>APAF, is a technology to facilitate development of cross-platform anonymous applications, for both desktop and server environments. It is used as a framework and build system to release GlobaLeaks. </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h2>Help us with the project</h2>
					<p>You can join the development of GlobaLeaks 0.3 with your Python (GLBackend, APAF), Javascript (GLClient) or C (Tor) skills depending on what you would like to hack on!</p>
					<p>The development of GlobaLeaks requires other kind of support and activities you may be interested in, contact us if you'd like to help with contributions regarding documentation or advocacy!</p>
					<p><strong>Outreach</strong><br/>We need help in planning and building outreach projects such as infographics, promotional videos, educational videos, web blogging, event promotion and so on.</p>
					<p><strong>Advocacy</strong><br/>We would like to know about new ideas and projects related to the implementation of anonymous whistleblowing initiatives.<br/>We also look for people proposing and organizing with the organization they know, the startup of new whistleblowing initiatives by actively advocating for a transparency action in their environment.</p>
